    Memphis is a city located along the Mississippi River in southwestern Shelby County, Tennessee, United States.
    The 2017 city population was 652,236,[5] making Memphis the largest city on the Mississippi River,[6] the second most populous
    city in Tennessee, as well as the 26th largest city in the United States. Greater Memphis is the 42nd largest metropolitan
    area in the United States, with a population of 1,348,260 in 2017.[7] The city is the anchor of West Tennessee and the greater
    Mid-South region, which includes portions of neighboring Arkansas and Mississippi. Memphis is the seat of Shelby County, the most
    populous county in Tennessee. As one of the most historic and cultural cities of the southern United States,
    the city features a wide variety of landscapes[citation needed] and distinct neighborhoods.

    The first European explorer to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541 with his expedition into the New World.
    The high bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi would then be contested between the Spanish, French, and the English as Memphis took shape.
    Modern Memphis was founded in 1819 by three prominent Americans: John Overton, James Winchester, and future president Andrew Jackson.[8]

    Memphis grew into one of the largest cities of the Antebellum South as a market for agricultural goods, natural resources like lumber, and the American slave trade.
    After the American Civil War and the end of slavery, the city experienced even faster growth into the 20th century as it became among the largest world markets
    for cotton[9] and lumber.

    Memphis has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with four distinct seasons, and is located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8a in downtown, cooling to 7b for much of the surrounding region.[50] Winter weather comes alternately from the upper Great Plains and the Gulf of Mexico, which can lead to drastic swings in temperature.
    Summer weather may come from Texas (very hot and humid) or the Gulf (hot and very humid). July has a daily average temperature of 82.7 °F (28.2 °C), with high levels of humidity due to moisture encroaching from the Gulf of Mexico. Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are frequent during summer, but usually brief, lasting no longer
    than an hour. Early autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can be hot until late October. Late autumn is rainy and cooler; precipitation peaks again in November and December. Winters are mild to chilly, with a January daily average temperature of 41.2 °F (5.1 °C). Snow occurs sporadically in winter, with an average seasonal snowfall of 3.9 inches (9.9 cm). Ice storms and freezing rain pose greater danger, as they can often pull tree limbs down on power lines and make driving hazardous. Severe thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year though mainly during the spring months. Large hail, strong winds, flooding and frequent lightning can accompany these storms.
    Some storms spawn tornadoes.
